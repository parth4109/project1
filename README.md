AQI Research Internship Project
This repository contains the code and data used for analyzing and predicting Air Quality Index (AQI) as part of my research internship project. The project focuses on data analysis to uncover trends and apply machine learning models to predict AQI for future dates.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:

Analyze historical AQI data to identify patterns.
Use machine learning models to predict future AQI values.
Provide insights into the effects of various environmental factors on AQI.
Repository Structure
data_analysis.ipynb: Contains the code for exploratory data analysis (EDA), including data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.
ml_model.ipynb: Implements machine learning models like FB Prophet and ARIMA for time series forecasting to predict future AQI trends.
data/: Contains the historical AQI dataset used in the analysis and prediction tasks.
results/: Contains the results of the analysis and model predictions, including visualizations and reports.
Data
The dataset used in this project consists of historical AQI data from Sanathnagar TSPCB monitoring station. The data was collected over multiple years, containing information about:

AQI levels
Pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NOx, etc.
Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/parth4109/project1.git
cd project1


Open the data_analysis.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
Run the notebook to explore and analyze the AQI dataset.
ML Model:

Open the ml_model.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
Train and evaluate the models on the AQI data.
Prediction:

Modify the prediction period in the notebook to forecast AQI for future dates.
Future Work
Explore advanced machine learning models to improve the accuracy of AQI predictions.
Integrate external data sources such as meteorological data to enhance the prediction models.
Results
The predictions generated by the model highlight the need for additional variables or model adjustments for better performance. The analysis also provides insights into AQI trends for the Sanathnagar area.
